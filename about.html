  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <!-- Main About Section -->
  <section class="intro">
    <h2>Born in the Himalayas</h2>
    <p>
      I was naturally drawn to the intricate balance of nature and the wisdom it holds. 
      Trained as a forester and ecologist, I specialize in remote sensing, utilizing advanced 
      geospatial technologies to understand landscapes, environmental changes, and ecosystem 
      dynamics. My expertise extends into artificial intelligence, where I integrate AI-driven 
      insights to enhance environmental monitoring, conservation, and sustainable resource 
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my scientific pursuits, my journey is deeply rooted in spirituality. Coming from 
      a Hindu family tradition, I have embraced the wisdom of multiple faiths—Christianity, 
      Buddhism, and Islam—finding harmony in their shared values of compassion, mindfulness, 
      service, and devotion to the Divine. To me, science and spirituality are not opposing 
      forces but complementary perspectives that guide my work and my worldview. Whether studying 
      the forests from above through remote sensing or seeking deeper truths through faith, I 
      strive to bridge knowledge and wisdom for a more sustainable and meaningful future.
    </p>

    <h2>Science Meets Spirituality</h2>
    <p>
      Rooted in Hinduism as my family tradition, I have grown to embrace the wisdom and spiritual 
      depth of Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam, seeing them not as contradictions but as different 
      paths toward understanding the Divine. From Hinduism, I inherit a deep sense of devotion 
      (Bhakti), the philosophy of unity (Advaita), and the sacred connection between the self and 
      the universe. In Christianity, I find the call to love, grace, and selfless service, which 
      align with the principles of dharma. In Buddhism, the practice of mindfulness and inner peace 
      guides me toward self-discipline and compassion. In Islam, I embrace the profound surrender 
      to the One God (Tawhid), the importance of justice, and the call to live a righteous life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than viewing these traditions as separate, I see them as different expressions of the 
      same eternal truth—leading toward a life of faith, wisdom, and harmony. Across these traditions, 
      I find inspiration in sacred words and prayers that uplift the soul. These powerful mantras, 
      verses, and supplications remind me of the divine presence in every moment of life.

    <h2>My Spiritual Inspirations</h2>

    </blockquote>

      Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
      Give us this day our daily bread,<br>
      and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>
      And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Psalm 23:1-4 (A prayer of faith and trust in God)</strong>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.<br>
      He makes me lie down in green pastures;<br>
      He leads me beside still waters;<br>
      He restores my soul.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Buddhism -->
    <h3>☸️ Buddhism</h3>
    <p><strong>The Buddha’s Metta (Loving-Kindness) Prayer</strong> – A prayer for compassion for all beings:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Sabbe Satta Sukhi Hontu</p>
      <p><em>“May all beings be happy.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>The Heart Sutra Mantra (For wisdom and enlightenment)</strong>:</p>

      <p>Gate Gate Pāragate Pārasamgate Bodhi Svāhā!</p>
      <p><em>“Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond—enlightenment, so be it!”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>The Triple Gem Refuge</strong> (A fundamental Buddhist affirmation of faith):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Buddham Saranam Gacchami (I take refuge in the Buddha),<br>
      Dhammam Saranam Gacchami (I take refuge in the Dharma),<br>
      Sangham Saranam Gacchami (I take refuge in the Sangha).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Islam -->
    <h3>☪️ Islam</h3>
    <p><strong>Surah Al-Fatiha (1:1-7)</strong> – The Opening Chapter of the Quran (Most Recited Prayer in Islam)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem,<br>
      Alhamdulillahi Rabbil 'Alamin,<br>
      Ar-Rahmanir-Raheem,<br>
      Maliki Yawmid-Deen,<br>
      Iyyaka Na’budu wa iyyaka nasta’een,<br>
      Ihdinas-Siratal-Mustaqeem,<br>
      Siratal-ladhina an’amta ‘alayhim, ghayril-maghdoobi ‘alayhim wa la-dhallin.</p>
      <p><em>“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, 
      Lord of all worlds. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment. 
      You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help. Guide us to the straight path—the path 
      of those whom You have blessed, not of those who have gone astray.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Shahada (Declaration of Faith in Islam)</strong>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammadur Rasulullah.</p>
      <p><em>“There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Ayat-ul-Kursi (Quran 2:255)</strong> – A Verse of Protection and Divine Power</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Allahu La Ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Hayyul-Qayyum...</p>
      <p><em>“Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence...”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      For me, these sacred words are not just prayers but a bridge between traditions—reminders 
      of divine love, wisdom, and peace. Whether in the Vedic hymns, the Psalms, the Buddha’s 
      teachings, or the Quranic verses, I find a universal call to truth, righteousness, and 
      devotion. My spiritual journey is not about choosing one over another, but about deepening 
      my connection with the Divine in all its expressions.
