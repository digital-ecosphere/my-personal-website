  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <!-- Main About Section -->
  <section class="intro" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;">
    <h2>Born in the Himalayas</h2>
    <p>
      I grew up amid the Himalayan forests, trained as a forester and remote‑sensing ecologist, and now apply AI‑driven geospatial tools to monitor and protect our planet. 
    </p>

    <h2>Science & Spirituality</h2>
    <p>
      My work bridges the analytical precision of science with the contemplative depth of spirituality. I believe true sustainability must be rooted not only in data, but also in ethics and reverence for all life.
    </p>

    <h2>Spiritual Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Over time, I’ve drawn strength and insight from multiple spiritual traditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hinduism:</strong> The Bhagavad Gita's message of detached action and devotion inspires my daily discipline and purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Buddhism:</strong> The teachings of impermanence, mindfulness, and compassion guide my ecological humility and non-attachment.</li>
      <li><strong>Christianity:</strong> The message of love, forgiveness, and sacrificial service echoes in my call to justice and environmental stewardship.</li>
      <li><strong>Islam:</strong> The Quranic verses—especially Surah Al-Fatiha and Ayat‑ul‑Kursi—offer me a constant reminder of divine mercy, guardianship, and unity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Faith as a Bridge</h2>
    <p>
      For me, sacred texts are not walls that divide us—they are bridges across traditions. The Vedas, the Dhammapada, the Gospels, and the Quran each offer a lens into truth. I see these as complementary streams flowing toward the same ocean of divine understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>Harmonizing Knowledge and Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
      My journey has been one of integration—of blending rigorous science with timeless wisdom, and of seeking a planetary ethic rooted in both insight and inspiration. I walk with gratitude across traditions, believing that ecology and faith together can help heal the Earth and the human spirit.
